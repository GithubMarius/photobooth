## Welcome to my Sony Photobooth-Project

This project is currently still under devlopment and is only tested with the NEX-6.
If you are able to run it, with a different camera, please contact, so I can list all camera models, that are working.
Make sure you have the latest "Smart Remote Control" installed on your camera.

Best regards,<br>
Marius
